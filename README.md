# Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Recognition

In a Driving Assistance System (ADAS), one of the main system checks is to find and recognize the road signs shown on the road to assist the driver ahead. This research paper aims to find traffic signs primary features and label them as well as focuses on recognizing them in oncoming traffic symbols and develop a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system by performing image recognition and identifying the sign recognized using different filters and shapes, patterns etc. This research was mainly focused on the CNN and its different  convolutional layers and feature sets to understand how they learn, recognize and predict in less time and with high accuracy.
